coding is hard
coding is art
coding is fun !
-------
emotional rollercoaster is REAL, don't fear it please: it's part of the process
--------
don't compare yourself with others : it's a fight against yourself ;)
during the class, during the labs, during the group projects
--------
ask questions : there is NO SUCH THING as a "stupid question"
just wait the proper moment please ;)
--------
take some notes : notebook, notion, google doc's, your call
--------
read the lesson : the day before is better !
cause we are not PDF reader ;)
--------
read the docs !!!! (google it ... MDN ... stackoverflow ... and many more :)
technical documentations are your best friends
research part is essential for a developer

mandatory steps : look for yourself > ask your friends > ask the TA's > ask the LT
--------
Try to be as autonomous as possible
the hacker spirit : finding the solution
developer : find a path from A -> Z
--------
DON'T COPY/PASTE CODE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ;)
the game is to find your own kung-fu
--------
read the console / read the terminal : even if it takes some time to master it 
coding requires READING !!!!
advice: do the debugging lab ;)
--------
about the "best practices" "good practices"
--------
wax on, wax off !!!
--------
code along : I'll let you finish
code demo : sit back, watch and relax (and ask questions :)
--------
